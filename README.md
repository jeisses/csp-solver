Knowledge Representation Project - CSP solver

## Value Ordering Heuristics for Sudoku CSPs

### Requirements
Python 2.7

### Project layout
Components are namespaced by their file.

**csp.py** contains the CSP sovler backtrack algorithm
**sudoku.py** contains functions for generating, parsing and displaying sudoku CSPs
**constraint.py** contains implementation of the constraint (ALL_DIFFERENT) and propagation algorithm
**heuristic.py** contains heuristic functions discussed in the project
